Wherever you like create two folders named "input" and "output"



Compulsory rasters that must be in the input folder: 

-DTM (dtm.tif)
-flood delineation  (flood.tif)



Optional rasters:

- exclusion mask   (exclusion.tif)
- water bodies     (permanent_water.tif)
- observed water:  flood water + permanent water bodies (obswater.tif)

NOTE: permanent_water.tif   and   obswater.tif   are exclusive, meaning you should have either one or the other. 



In the script FLEXTH.py assign the appropriate paths to the Input/Output folders

Adjust the mode parameters if you want. 
See Betterle & Salamon (2024) on NHESS for details (https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2817-2024). 


Run the script. 

The geotiff raster with estimated water depths (in cm) and water level (in m) will be created in the Output folder.

Open with a GIS and possibly adjust the limits of the displayed  values (e.g. between 0 and 200 cm for the water depth). 
Permanent water bodies (if provided) will be displayed with a dummy 9999 water depth.
